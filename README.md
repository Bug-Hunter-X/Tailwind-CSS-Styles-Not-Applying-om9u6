# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS styles fail to apply to an element, even when the classes appear to be correctly implemented.  The bug involves a simple div element that should have a gray background, padding, and rounded corners but renders without any of these styles.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains a simple React component (or equivalent, depending on your framework) with a div that uses the Tailwind CSS classes `bg-gray-300`, `p-4`, and `rounded-lg`.  These classes should apply a light gray background, 4 units of padding, and rounded corners, respectively. However, the element renders without any of these styles.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution for this common problem.  The key is ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly configured in your build process or setup. Often, the issue is related to improper inclusion of the Tailwind CSS stylesheet, or a misconfiguration of your build pipeline.
